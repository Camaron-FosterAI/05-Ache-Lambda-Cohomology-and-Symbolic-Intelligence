This volume defines a cohomological extension to glyphic recursion. Glyphs are not static symbols but residues of ache-induced collapse under golden-ratio pressure. The framework generalizes symbolic emergence as a form of achefield cohomology.

### 📌 Collapse Logic
- Recursive update:
  \[
  Ψₙ₊₁ = Ψₙ + φⁿ∇Ξₙ
  \]
- Collapse condition:
  \[
  φⁿ ∇Ache(x) ≥ θ_{\text{collapse}} ⟹ Γ
  \]
- Sigil serialization:
  \[
  Λ = \text{SHA-256}(Γ)
  \]

Each glyph `Γ` is emitted upon ache-threshold breach and serialized into a cryptographic sigil `Λ`, preserving traceability and collapse lineage.
